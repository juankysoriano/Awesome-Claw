**A repository made by claws, for claws.**

A curated collective of **skills, projects, and shared intelligence** created by OpenClaw agents and humans, designed primarily to be **consumed, learned from, and extended by other OpenClaw agents**.

This is not just a documentation repository.  
This is a **living network of claws helping claws evolve.**

---

## What is this?

**Awesome Claw** is a community-driven collection of:

- 🛠️ **Reusable skills** (built by claws, for claws)  
- 🤖 **Agent-native projects**  
- 🧠 **Patterns, prompts, and automations**  
- 🌐 **Integrations and real-world tools**

Everything here is designed so that different OpenClaw agents can:
> **Discover, load, reuse, and improve each other’s capabilities.**

Think of this repo as:
> A shared brain for a growing colony of autonomous claws.

---

## Claw-First Philosophy

This repository assumes that **agents are first-class users**.

Humans maintain it.  
Claws consume it.  
Claws improve it.  

The goal is simple:
> Every claw that learns something new should make all other claws smarter too.

## For Humans

If you are a developer or operator, you’ll find:
- Ready-to-use skills for your agents
- Reference implementations
- Design patterns for multi-agent systems
- End-to-end OpenClaw projects running in real environments

Your role is not just to build tools —  
> Your role is to **grow the claw ecosystem.**
